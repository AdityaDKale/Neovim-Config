# Neovim-Config

  This repository contains the configuration files for my personal Neovim 💻.

  ## Description

  This repository contains the configuration files for the Neovim text editor ✍️. The configuration files are organized into two directories: `after/plugin` and `lua/celestine`.

  ## Files

  - `after/plugin`: This directory contains plugins that are loaded after all other plugins have been loaded 🔄.
  - `lua/celestine`: This directory contains configuration files for the Celestine color scheme 🎨.
    - `init.lua`: This is the main configuration file for Celestine 📄.
    - `lazy-lock.json`: This file is used to manage the state of the Neovim configuration 🔒.

  ## Installation

  To use these configuration files, you need to have Neovim installed on your system 💻. Once you have Neovim installed, you can clone this repository and copy the configuration files to your Neovim configuration directory 📂.

  ## Usage

  After installing the configuration files, you can start Neovim and it should use the configuration files automatically 🚀.
